# WebPitchBlackStyles
WenPitchBlackStyles offers a collection of Pitch Black CSS scripts to enhance websites with a stylish dark mode.

### Instructions

1. **For Chromium-based Browsers**: Install the [User JavaScript and CSS extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld?hl=en).
2. Once installed, add the website you want to customize, and copy and paste the desired Pitch Black CSS theme from this repository.
3. **For Firefox**: I can't find any good extension to properly do this for now.

Iâ€™m currently working on a similar extension; please stay tuned for updates!

Your feedback and contributions are appreciated as we improve the experience!
